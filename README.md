# Time-series-analysis-of-technology-stocks-and-prediction-using-the-LSTM-method
This is a detailed descriptive and exploratory analysis of technology stocks and prediction using the LSTM method.

A time series is a collection of data points gathered over a period of time and ordered chronologically. Time series analysis can effectively illustrate that data points taken over time may have some sort of trend or pattern that likely otherwise would have gone undiscovered. Thus, time series data is important in the field of data science and data analysis.

In this notebook, we will discover and explore data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft). We will learn how to use yfinance to get stock information, and visualize different aspects of it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method!

We'll be answering the following questions along the way:
In this notebook, I perform a detailed descriptive and exploratory analysis of stock data, as well as a prediction of the data using the Long short-term memory networks(LSTM) method.

Specifically, you learn:

How to load stock market data from the YAHOO Finance website using yfinance.
How to explore and visualize time-series data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
How to measure the correlation between stocks.
How to measure the risk of investing in a particular stock.
